    **Fact 8.** [Vaush is a self-confessed sexual harasser.](https://archive.is/hS0cB) Despite this ‘apology’ he went on to ‘joke’ about [scaring his victim into shutting up](https://archive.is/joDh9), said [he had ‘done nothing to feel remorseful for’](https://archive.is/joDh9) and [‘nothing to apologise over’](https://archive.is/NVOv6). In fact, his own sysadmin suggested [he change his handle](https://archive.is/eaA4a) to hide from sexual harassment allegations.

    One of his victims, Poppy, states that she was a vulnerable autistic person and he “tried to groom her”. He reportedly said he wanted to “prolapse (her) anus” and “rape her for months on end.” [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20190723031344/https://twitter.com/wooloosmommy/status/1147253945829666817) Poppy goes on to say that at the time she “felt like killing herself every day” and Vaush “took advantage of that to try and get sex.” She also says that Vaush’s Discord members and friends tried to smear her and branded her an “attention seeker.”[Source](https://archive.is/79wMN)

    Vaush stated that he tried apologising to Poppy [but she ‘ignored his attempts’ and had blocked him.](https://archive.is/xpL2Q/3f247ae826f6610b20895fbaf52e46034311911d.webp) Poppy repsonded with proof that Vaush has, in fact, [blocked her.](https://archive.is/xpL2Q/560b65f46bbd4fec36253cf818d8b5e9d7a2d9d1.webp) Vaush also contradicts his (and his fans) claim that he publicly apologised to Poppy [here.](https://archive.is/hS0cB) He said “to make a video publicly apologizing to two private individuals for behavior which took place variably seven months or two and a half years ago - when I barely had and didn't have a public platform, respectively - seems ridiculous to me.”
